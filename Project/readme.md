# Crop Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

This project aims to predict crop prices for the crops, Arecanut(Coca) and Coconut(Grade-I), in the Mangaluru market. The dataset spans from January 1st 2015 to December 31st 2022 and used an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for time series prediction.

## Using the Repository

To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vij7777pai/AIML-INTERNSHIP.git 
```

## Notebooks

- [Coca.ipynb](Coca.ipynb): Contains code for predicting Arecanut prices.
- [Grade-I.ipynb](grade-I.ipynb): Contains code for predicting Coconut prices.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file.

### Create a Virtual Environment (Python 3.10.11)

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment named 'project-venv'
python3.10 -m venv project-venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Dataset

*The dataset is stored in Excel format (.xlsx) located in the Datasets folder. 
  - ./Dataset/Coca/Coca(2015-2022).xlsx for Arecanut
  - ./Dataset/Grade-I/GRADE-I(2015-2022).xlsx for Coconut

## Process

### Data Collection 

* Collected historical crop price data for Arecanut and Coconut in the Mangaluru market from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2022 from [here](https://krama.karnataka.gov.in/department.aspx)

### Data Preprocessing

* Loaded the excel file.
    * Changed it to pandas DataFrame
* Handled missing data, if any, by filling gaps or removing incomplete records.
* Explored the dataset to understand its characteristics.

### Feature Extracion

* Extracted relevant features that can improve prediction accuracy such as Minimum, Maximum and Modal prices.

### Sequence Generation

* Generated sequences of data points for training, where each sequence contains a window of historical data that the LSTM model will use to make predictions.
    * In this project, we have utilized an input sequence of 3 consecutive days' worth of historical crop price data, and our LSTM model leverages this information to make accurate predictions of future prices in the Mangaluru market 

### Model Architecture

Defined the LSTM model architecture using Keras:

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(InputLayer((3,3)))
model.add(LSTM(64))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(30, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(3))
```

### Model Training

* Trained the LSTM model using the training dataset. Monitored performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.

### Model Evaluation

* Evaluated the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). Visualized predictions against actual prices.

### Saving the Best Model

* The best-performing model is saved in the 'models' folder for future use.

### Saving the scaler objects 

* Scaler objects used for data normalization are saved in the Scaler Objects folder. These scalers can be applied to new data before making predictions with the trained model.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

* Experimented with different hyperparameter to optimize the model's performance.
  * Changing the input sequence
  * Adding new units, layers
  * learning rate, epochs

### Fine-tuning and Deployment

Once satisfied with the model's performance, fine-tuned it with the entire dataset. Deployed the trained model for making real-time predictions on streamlit.

To run the streamlit_deploy.py code, you'll need to install the streamlit module using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```
Once after installing run this command in Command prompt

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_deploy.py
```
